\title{Import, process, and export data from Argos downloads}
\usage{
assign_info(tt.dat, tt.deployed)
}
\arguments{
\item{tt.dat}{data frame; the raw(ish) data from the ARGOS download}

\item{tt.deployed}{data frame; the log containing deployment information for each tag}
}
\value{
A data frame with more informative Argos data
}
\description{
Add specific information to the ARGOS data set produced by \code{\link{import_argos}}
}
\details{
This ugly pile of braces, brackets, fors, ifs, and elses will assign
Spp, Site, Study, etc. designations to each record in the file
for which deployment information is available.
It goes row by row through the giant data set, so expect it to take awhile
when processing lots of data

Ready. Set. Go.
